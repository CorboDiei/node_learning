// In the previous sections, we had to restart our server every time we wanted to see changes
// We can make some changes to this using a package manager called npm
// We can also add packages that are not a part of default node
// We can also use it to manage projects

// If we want to run a script from the npm command, we can do so with either npm start or
// npm run script-name

// nodemon is a development dependency
